		<p>Billion years ago when the universe was nothingness. A magical explosion occurred and a horse-like creature appeared. 
		He is known by the name “Archorner”. Own himself a superior power, he created other 3 gods and they respectively are 
		Delphini, Pterous, and Gigantipede.<p>		
		Delphini, the first creation of Archorner, has the exteriority of a dolphin but with wings. She has a shiny golden crown on her head. 
		The glowing blue eyes just look like the spectacular galaxies. She has a mission that is to protect and preserve any good life in the universe, 
		especiallly from the God of Destruction – Gigantipede (if something is wrong with his judgment). She is overall a funny, harmonious, friendly 
		god and rarely intercede in a battle.<p>
		Pterous, the second creation that came after Delphini, has the same outside look as the pterosaurs which might be the origin of his name.  
		The green skin appears just like a representation of life. And that is his purpose of existing. He along with Archorner is the two creators 
		of any life in the universe. His 2 colossal wings are a big deal with anyone who messed with him. He is not so peaceful like Delphini but a 
		neutral god. He is easily caught in a fight with Gigantipede.<p>
		The last but not least, Gigantipede – God of Destruction. He is a formidable giant centipede with red wings and spikes around his body. 
		His appearance looks like something related to hell. As the name suggests, he is created just to destroy and punish anything that goes 
		against the benefit of the universe. He might be the most powerful god in the three. With the power flowing in all parts of the long body,
		he is also the most aggressive and combative. Archorner himself has to warn him a lot of his actions for<p><hr>
